🏦MiniBankingSystem

Hello! I'm a student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Düzce University. This C++ banking system, which I developed in my first year, demonstrates my knowledge of object-oriented programming and file I/O. It's part of my portfolio for applying to a master's degree in embedded systems.

🚀Features

Creating new accounts with unique account numbers
Depositing and withdrawing funds
Viewing the account balance
Listing all registered accounts
Saving/loading account data to a file (accounts.txt)
Basic input validation and error handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
File I/O (ifstream, ofstream)
Vector, string, and other STL components
Simple error handling logic

📌Purpose

This project was created for the following purposes:

Demonstrate proficiency in C++ and object-oriented programming
Implement file-based data persistence
Prepare for advanced embedded system projects (e.g., STM32, FreeRTOS) as an electrical and electronics engineer

📅 Updates

August 28, 2025: First release completed
Next steps: Developing real-time embedded projects with STM32 and FreeRTOS
