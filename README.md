🏦 MiniBankingSystem

A simple banking system I developed in C++ during my first year at Düzce University. I'm currently working on embedded systems for my master's degree, and this project helped me practice object-oriented programming and file operations.

🚀 Features

- Creating new accounts with unique account numbers
- Depositing and withdrawing funds
- Viewing the account balance
- Listing all registered accounts
- Saving/loading account data to a file (accounts.txt)
- Basic input validation and error handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O (ifstream, ofstream)
- Vector, string, and other STL components
- Simple error handling logic

📌 Purpose

This project was created for the following purposes:

- Practicing C++ and reinforcing OOP principles
- Learning file management and persistent storage
- Preparing myself for future embedded systems work (e.g., STM32, FreeRTOS)

📅 Updates

- August 28, 2025: First version completed
- I am currently preparing to work on STM32 and FreeRTOS-based systems and developing real-time embedded projects.
